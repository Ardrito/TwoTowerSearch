      "Negative: Bureau of Labor Statistics information for states that an Occupational Therapist median salary in 2010 was $72,320 a year which is about $34.77 an hour. An occupational therapist typically requires a Master’s Degree in order to get this pay and a position in the job market. This will add around 36,400 jobs to the total occupational therapy job market from 2010 – 2020.

      "Negative: Most often, tonsillitis is caused by a virus. Less often, it is caused by the same bacteria that cause strep throat. In rare cases, a fungus or a parasite can cause it. Tonsillitis is spread through the air in droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. If your tonsillitis is caused by strep, you need treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics can help prevent rare but serious problems caused by strep and can control the spread of infection. As a rule, doctors only advise surgery to remove tonsils (tonsillectomy) when there are serious problems with the tonsils.\n",

      "Positive: Apothem of a hexagon. The apothem of a regular polygon is a line segment from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. Equivalently, it is the line drawn from the center of the polygon that is perpendicular to one of its sides. The word apothem can also refer to the length of that line segment. Because of this, all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent. For a regular pyramid, which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon, the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face; that is, the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face.\n",
      "Negative: Best Answer: In the United States, you can carry as much cash as you want. There are limits, though, on how you can use large quantities of cash. For instance, if you carry $20,000 in cash to a car dealer, the dealer has to report the transaction to the authorities. The reason is that drug dealers, smugglers, and other criminals tend to work entirely in cash.\n",
